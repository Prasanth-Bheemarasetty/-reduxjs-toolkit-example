# Redux Toolkit Implementation in React

This React project demonstrates how to use the Redux Toolkit library to manage state in your application, with examples of both single slice per store and multi slice per store scenarios.

## Features

- Implements Redux Toolkit to simplify Redux logic and improve code maintainability.
- Provides examples of two common scenarios for using Redux Toolkit:
  - Single slice per store: creates a single Redux slice to hold all application state.
  - Multi slice per store: creates multiple Redux slices to hold different parts of the application state, and combines them into a single root reducer.
- Uses `createSlice` function to define reducers, actions, and selectors for Redux slices.
- Uses `createAsyncThunk` function to handle asynchronous actions.
- Uses `configureStore` function to configure the Redux store.
- Uses `useSelector` hook to access state from components.
- Uses middleware to handle asynchronous actions.
- Provides examples of common Redux patterns, such as handling loading and error states, and using memoized selectors.
- Integrates with Redux DevTools extension for debugging Redux state changes.
